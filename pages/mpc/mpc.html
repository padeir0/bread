    <h2 id="mp-briefly">A brief description of Millipascal</h2>
    <p>
      Millipascal is a simple imperative language.
      It looks like Pascal, hence the name. Here's a hello-world program:
    </p>
<pre><code>from io import print

data hello "Hello, World!\n"

proc main
begin
  print[hello, sizeof[hello]];
end
</code></pre>
    <p>
      This program hardly shows anything about the language.
      But what we can see is that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is some sort of module system</li>
      <li>For some reason I didn't place the string literal inline with the print call</li>
      <li>There is an entry point called <code>main</code></li>
      <li>Functions appear to be called with square brackets</li>
      <li>It looks like Pascal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Millipascal is very minimalistic, the reason string literals are not directly
      present in expressions is that they are only treated as blobs,
      just like you would treat strings in assembly. The identifier
      <code>hello</code> evaluates to a pointer (<code>ptr</code>),
      completely untyped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides pointers, we have the basic signed integers and
      unsigned integers from 8 bits to 64 bits, and a boolean.
      The boolean is not strictly necessary, but it helps when
      we're trying to validate our compiler transformations (more
      on that later).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, why would I choose square brackets over parenthesis
      for function calls? That is: why <code>f[]</code> instead of
      <code>f()</code>? There are three main reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Parenthesis already have a job inside expressions: to disambiguate and group terms</li>
      <li>It takes less finger acrobatics to type <code>[</code> than <code>(</code> </li>
      <li>I find it prettier.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After you get used to this call syntax, it grows on you.
      Initially it was a decision based purely to make the grammar
      more robust, then i started seeing other advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if you're familiar with how <code>print</code> is implemented
      in other languages, you know how weird our software stack
      can get. In millipascal it is not much better, here's
      one of the few assembly procedures I ever got working in the language:
    </p>

<pre><code>export print

const begin
    SYS_WRITE = 1;
    STDOUT = 1;
end

proc print&lt;stack&gt;[p:ptr, size:i32] i64
asm
begin
    push rbp;
    mov rbp, rsp;

    mov r0, {SYS_WRITE};
    mov r2d, [rbp, size]@dword;
    mov r6, [rbp, p]@qword;
    mov r7, {STDOUT};
    syscall;

    mov [rbp, _ret0]@qword, r0;
    mov rsp, rbp;
    pop rbp;
    ret;
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      This directly implements the write syscall on linux for amd64.
      Lot's more questions may be raised about this piece of code.
      The <code>export print</code> is
      how we make names public to other modules.
      When you see <code>&lt;stack&gt;</code>, this is specifying
      the ABI the procedure will use. Only one ABI was ever implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      If by now you haven't realised yet, this project was never finished.
      It is functional, and I've even wrote a arbitrary precision
      number library for the language, but some features never got fully
      developed. The support for multiple ABIs exist, but only one ABI
      was ever implemented. The support for ASM procedures exist, but
      only few procedures got throughly used and tested. This is what
      happens when projects grow out of proportion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following procedure converts a buffer to uppercase.
      This one is much more interesting, it shows that the language
      has support for first class procedures, and that global symbols
      can be declared out of order.
    </p>
<pre><code>from io import print

data buff "am i uppercase yet?\n"

proc main
begin
  byte_map[buff, sizeof[buff], upper_case];
  print[buff, sizeof[buff]];
end

proc byte_map[b:ptr, bsize:i32, op:proc[i8][i8]]
var i:i32
begin
  set i = 0;
  while i &lt; bsize begin
    set (b+i)@i8 = op[(b+i)@i8];
    set i += 1;
  end
end

proc upper_case[a:i8] i8
begin
  if a &gt;= 'a' and a &lt;= 'z' begin
    return a - 32ss;
  end
  return a;
end
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Here, <code>(b+i)@i8</code> is a pointer offset followed
      by a dereference. It reads
      "take b, add i and read an <code>i8</code> from that address".
      There are other ways to do this, in fact, the language has
      support for indexing, but it requires introducing the
      semantics behind <code>struct</code> (it's different from C,
      much to your dismay).
    </p>
    <p>
      To be more precise, structs in millipascal are only syntax sugar
      for pointers, they are not values per se, only compile-time
      metadata for pointers.
      Here's some code that uses structs to benefit from the use of
      the indexing syntax:
    </p>
    <p>
      (Note that <code>~</code> is the unary minus in Millipascal).
    </p>
<pre><code>from ioutil import put_int, put_char

struct I32A begin
    num:i32;
end

data my_ints:I32A {
    5, ~10, 2, 50, ~9, 65, 0
}
const my_ints_length = sizeof[my_ints]/sizeof[I32A];

proc main
begin
    print_ints[my_ints, my_ints_length];
    insertion_sort[my_ints, my_ints_length];
    print_ints[my_ints, my_ints_length];
end

proc insertion_sort[array:I32A, length:i32]
var i, j:i32
begin
    set i = 1;
    while i &lt length begin
        set j = i;
        while j &gt; 0 and
              array[j-1]-&gt;num &gt; array[j]-&gt;num begin
            set array[j]-&gt;num &lt&gt; array[j-1]-&gt;num;
            set j -= 1;
        end
        set i += 1;
    end
end

proc print_ints[array:I32A, length:i32]
var i:i32
begin
    set i = 0;
    while i &lt length begin
        put_int[array[i]-&gt;num:i64];
        put_char[' '];
        set i += 1;
    end
    put_char['\n'];
end</code></pre>
    <p>
      It may seem confusing, but <code>array[i]</code> is only
      syntax sugar for <code>array+(i * sizeof[I32A])</code>.
      The <code>-&gt;</code> operator performs a dereference, just like in
      C. It is sugar for <code>(pointer+offset)@type</code>, in this particular case,
      the offset is zero, so the expression <code>array[i]-&gt;num</code>
      is sugar for:
    </p>
    <pre><code>(array+(i * sizeof[I32A]))@i32</code></pre>
    <p>
      Structs are a bit more powerful than that, we're able to specify
      the offsets of fields, and even have negative offsets. This may
      seem silly, but i implemented that already thinking of a use-case:
      storing metadata about an object.
    </p>
<pre><code># object header
struct Obj [sizeof[i64]] begin
    Size:i64 {~sizeof[i64]};
end</code></pre>
    <p>
      This <code>Obj</code> struct is used inside the
      <a href="https://github.com/padeir0/millipascal/blob/master/test_suite/stdlib/flalloc.mp">flalloc.mp</a>
      allocator
      to retrieve the size of objects that come from user code:
    </p>
    <pre><code>set size = (p:Obj)->Size;</code></pre>
    <p>
      So far this is only a taste of the weird quirks of the language,
      a few more will crop up on the way, but now you know what rabbit
      hole you're getting into. If it is not clear how some mechanism
      of the language works, a <a href="../millipascal-spec/spec.html">specification</a> is available. If even
      then something seems wrong, please feel free to

    <h2 id="comparch">The overall compiler architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The compiler is a monolithic 15kloc project separated into various modules,
      it generates FASM assembly and depends on FASM to generate ELF files.

      Names of most stages here mirror the names of folders in
      the source. Here's a quick summary of the repository and
      the respective total line count of each directory.

    <p>
      This gives you an idea of how complex each compiler phase is,
      for example, lexing is rather simple, thus
      the line count of <code>lexer</code> is smaller than a more complicated stage
      like the <code>typechecker</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The file that describes most of the diagrams seen here
      is the <code>pipelines/pipelines.go</code> file. It contains
      the code that glues all compiler phases together, it may
      be helpfull to consult this file while reading this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>core</code> folder contains all public data structures
      used throughout the compiler, a quick summary follows.
    </p>
<pre><code>core           3420

└── core.go    141</pre></code>
    <p>
      Here, the most important data structures are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>asm</code> which is a in-memory representation of assembly code, henceforth refered to as ASM</li>
      <li><code>module</code> which represents the source using an abstract syntax tree (AST) and represents modules with a dependency graph</li>
      <li><code>types</code> which represents the structure of types, including structs</li>
      <li><code>pir</code> which is the main intermediate representation of source, based on a control flow graph (CFG)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The file <code>core.go</code> contains the <code>Error</code> data structure
      that is used almost everywhere in the source (hence it is the most core
      of the core data structures).
    </p>
    <p>
      Internally, the compiler is separated into frontend and backend.
      The frontend is aware of how the language syntax works, and
      transforms the higher level, syntax-oriented representation of source
      into a semantic-oriented intermediate representation called PIR.
      The backend is only aware of the minute semantics of the intermediate
      representation, having only to understand the underlying abstract machine.
      The backend transforms PIR into lower representations and emits textual assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assembly procedures are directly transformed to the last representation
      the compiler has of the code: ASM. ASM is a in-memory
      representation of assembly code and, in the diagrams, is not the same
      as the "assembly" outputs. Don't worry too much about the nuances
      of each representation now, these will be explained in detail later.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./images/arch/mpc-only.svg" alt="mpc only">
      <figcaption>mpc only</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      PIR is a high-level representation of the semantics of millipascal,
      it is quite different from the syntax tree of the first stages.
      The frontend is also composed of several stages to transform 
      millipascal source into PIR.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./images/arch/frontend.svg" alt="frontend">
      <figcaption>frontend</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Stage 0 is concerned in resolving all dependencies and all types.
      It extracts all necessary information from the source
      so that the stage 1 is able
      to properly transform the <i>module</i> representation
      into PIR.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most compiler errors will be emitted during stage 0, the only
      few errors coming out of stage 1 are related to control flow
      and entry points.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./images/arch/frontend_stage0.svg" alt="frontend stage 0">
      <figcaption>stage 0</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Stage 0 starts with the resolution phase, it finds
      all dependencies, builds the dependency graph and checks all
      global declarations for name usage. It creates the <i>module</i>
      data structure, which contains dependencies, the abstract syntax tree,
      and space to place information collected in other phases. If everything is well with name resolution and no errors are found,
      then execution proceeds to the typechecking phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typechecking is the first phase that deals with types. It infers
      and checks types at the same time and fills the syntax tree
      with the types of each expression. Besides types, it also checks
      for other semantic problems like if assignments are well formed
      or if a procedure with multiple returns is being used in an
      expression. If no problems are found in typechecking,
      execution proceeds to the <i>constexpr</i> phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constant evaluation phase (<i>constexpr</i>) is a small
      pass that evaluates constants in global symbols and
      <code>sizeof</code> expressions using arbitrary precision
      arithmetic (bignums). It has to run after all types are known
      so that numbers can be constrained to their fixed sizes.
      After <i>constexpr</i>,
      constants are just numbers, and incur no runtime overhead.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./images/arch/frontend_stage1.svg" alt="frontend stage 1">
      <figcaption>stage 1</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The stage 1 starts with the <i>asmproc</i> phase, which parses
      assembly procedures into the ASM representation. It needs to run
      in this exact place in the pipeline to use evaluated constants,
      and to avoid keeping syntax trees through the next phase. It also
      checks for semantic errors like invalid labeling or invalid
      instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>linearization</i> phase is a very complicated phase
      that transforms the whole source, including all dependencies,
      into a single PIR object. It mainly works on top the AST
      to transform it into a CFG. The only error this phase emits
      is regarding missing returns in procedures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, after PIR is built, a phase checks if the representation
      is well formed. This phase is located in <code>core/pir/checker</code>
      as it is part of the semantics of the data structure.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./images/arch/backend.svg" alt="backend">
      <figcaption>backend</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The backend is where most of my tears have been shed. It starts by
      transforming PIR into a lower level representation called MIR,
      this is the job of <i>regalloc</i> (register allocator).
      This representation cares about where things are stored and
      implements a simplified version of what will be written in
      assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After MIR is created, a validation phase performs abstract
      interpretation of the code to check if everything is well-formed.
      This validation is crucial and often caught a lot of bugs in
      the register allocator, bugs that previously required chasing
      segmentation faults.
    </p>
    <p>
      If MIR is well-formed, the next stage is to transform it
      into ASM, joining it together with the assembly procedures
      generated in the <i>asmproc</i> phase. Transforming
      MIR into ASM requires some workarounds related to
      weird quirks of the amd64 architecture, quirks i only got
      to know after many segfaults.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the last phase transforms ASM into textual assembly
      following the syntax rules of the FASM assembler. This is rather
      simple and is almost an one-to-one translation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="error">Errors</h2>
    <p>
      The compiler halts as soon as it encounters a single error.
      This is simple, but sufficient, as long as the user knows
      a bit about what he is doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a single <code>Error</code> type. This type is used
      everywhere in the compiler, and contains information
      to communicate errors with the user. Here it is:
    </p>
<pre><code>type Error struct {
	Code     et.ErrorKind
	Severity sv.Severity
	Message  string
	Location *Location
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      The type <code>ErrorKind</code> is the error code, enumerated on
      the file <code>src/core/error/errorkind.go</code>. This is used
      mostly to test the compiler as i don't remember a single error
      code from the top of my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>Serverity</code> is barely used, the only two used kinds
      are <code>Error</code> and <code>InternalError</code>. Which
      represent, respectivelly, errors to blame on the user
      and errors that are my fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>Message</code> is simply a string with the error message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, <code>Location</code> is a bit more complicated. Here is 
      the full definition:
    </p>
<pre><code>type Location struct {
	File  string
	Range *Range
}

type Range struct {
	Begin Position
	End   Position
}

type Position struct {
	Line   int
	Column int
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Because most editors are line oriented, it is important that <code>Position</code>
      represents something the user can understand. The type <code>Range</code> simply
      encodes a section of source, from beginning to end. While the field <code>file</code>
      is the file name of the source.
    </p>
    <p>
      To display the error to the user, a simple <code>String</code> method
      transforms the error to a string representation. This code is
      located in <code>src/core/core.go:120</code>.
    </p>
<pre><code>func (this *Error) String() string {
	source := this.Location.Source()
	message := this.Location.String() + " " +
		this.Severity.String() +
		": " + this.Message
	if source != "" {
		return message + "\n" + source
	}
	return message
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      To print the source in the error message, the file is opened again
      and the section is extracted. The offending part is then coloured red
      using ANSI color codes. Here's some typical <code>mpc</code> errors:
    </p>
<pre><code>fact.mp:2:4 to 2:14 error: invalid number of arguments, expected: 1
    if <span style="color: red;">fact[5, 5]</span> != 120 begin

      As you can see, errors are simple and sometimes even bad, but they're good

    <h2 id="hir">The High Level Intermediate Representation</h2>
    <p>
      The first intermediate representation is the <code>Module</code> type.
      Defined in <code>src/core/module/module.go:82</code>. This data structure
      aglomerates information of the source, including scopes, syntax trees, 
      module graphs, types, etc.
    </p>
<pre><code>type Module struct {
	BasePath string
	Name     string
	FullPath string
	Root     *Node

	Globals      map[string]*Global
	Dependencies map[string]*Dependency
	Exported     map[string]*Global

	Visited bool
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      A module has a one to one relation with the source files, this is why <code>FullPath</code>
      is present in the structure. Similarly, all imported modules are also files, and each have
      a corresponding <code>Module</code> instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three maps, <code>Globals</code>, <code>Dependencies</code> and <code>Exported</code>
      are first populated by the name resolution phase. The <code>map[string]*Dependency</code>
      declares a map of modules, creating a dependency graph. Here's the definition of <code>Dependency</code>:
    </p>
<pre><code>type Dependency struct {
	M      *Module
	Source *Node
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      It is a simple pair of a <code>Module</code> and the node where that module was imported.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="ast">The abstract syntax tree (AST)</h2>
    <p>
      The abstract syntax tree represents the source code using an hierarchical data structure.
      The compiler can output AST by calling it with <code>mpc --ast file.mp</code>. For
      example, consider the following code.
    </p>
<pre><code>proc fact[n:i32] i32
begin
	if n == 0 begin
		return 1;
	end
	return n * fact[n-1];
end</code></pre>
    <p>
      Omitting the topmost node, becomes the following mess:
    </p>
<pre><code>└─>{proc, 'proc':nil, 0:0 to 6:3}
    └─>{identifier, 'fact':nil, 0:5 to 0:9}
    └─>{parameters, '':nil, 0:10 to 0:15}
        └─>{:, ':':nil, 0:10 to 0:15}
            └─>{id list, '':nil, 0:10 to 0:11}
                └─>{identifier, 'n':nil, 0:10 to 0:11}
            └─>{i32, 'i32':nil, 0:12 to 0:15}
    └─>{type list, '':nil, 0:17 to 0:20}
        └─>{i32, 'i32':nil, 0:17 to 0:20}
    └─>nil
    └─>{block, '':nil, 1:0 to 6:3}
        └─>{if, 'if':nil, 2:1 to 4:4}
            └─>{==, '==':nil, 2:4 to 2:10}
                └─>{identifier, 'n':nil, 2:4 to 2:5}
                └─>{i32 literal, '0':nil, 2:9 to 2:10}
            └─>{block, '':nil, 2:11 to 4:4}
                └─>{return, 'return':nil, 3:2 to 3:10}
                    └─>{i32 literal, '1':nil, 3:9 to 3:10}
            └─>nil
            └─>nil
        └─>{return, 'return':nil, 5:1 to 5:21}
            └─>{*, '*':nil, 5:8 to 5:21}
                └─>{identifier, 'n':nil, 5:8 to 5:9}
                └─>{procedure call, '':nil, 5:12 to 5:21}
                    └─>{expression list, '':nil, 5:17 to 5:20}
                        └─>{-, '-':nil, 5:17 to 5:20}
                            └─>{identifier, 'n':nil, 5:17 to 5:18}
                            └─>{i32 literal, '1':nil, 5:19 to 5:20}
                    └─>{identifier, 'fact':nil, 5:12 to 5:16}
    └─>nil</code></pre>
    <p>
      You may find this unreadable, but i guarantee that after hours of debugging,
      you will still find it unreadable. Anyway, here's what the compiler is telling you,
      considering the excerpt <code>{identifier, 'fact':nil, 0:5 to 0:9}</code>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The indentation shows how deep the node is in the tree</li>
      <li>The first field tells you what kind of node it is, in this case, it is an <code>identifier</code></li>
      <li>
        The second field is the section directly from the source, in this case <code>'fact'</code>,
        followed by the type of the node, in this case, <code>nil</code> because types were still
        not inferred.
      </li>
      <li>
        The third and last field tells you where this node occurs in the source.
        Since this is an identifier, it corresponds to the <code>'fact'</code> token, directly from
        source. But other nodes, like the <code>return</code> will comprise of longer sections.
        The first tuple of numbers represents the line and column of the beginning of the node,
        that is, like <code>line:colum</code>. The second one represents the end.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now, if we ignore all the clutter, here's the graph representation of that piece of code:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./images/syntax-tree.svg" alt="overall">
      <figcaption>syntax tree for the fact.mp program</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Here you can see much better the structure of the grammar, this is implemented inside the
      compiler as a simple recursive data structure, you can find it in <code>src/core/module/module.go:17</code>.
    </p>
<pre><code>type Node struct {
	Text   string
	Lex    LxK.LexKind
	Leaves []*Node

	Type     *T.Type
	MultiRet bool // if this is true, T == nil

	Value *big.Int // for int literals

	Range *Range
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Fields are filled depending on the type of the node, and in different phases of the compiler.
      There are other ways to implement this data structure, for example, by using sum types.
      Go does not have sum types, so we have to live with big structs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field <code>Leaves</code> is how the tree is linked together. It is
      simply linked in a single direction, and all passes go top-down on the AST.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="lexemes">Lexemes (Nodes)</h2>
    <p>
      A Lexeme's single objective is
      labeling a section of source. In <code>mpc</code>, lexemes do
      not exist as a separate data structure. Instead, it is 
      inlined with the abstract syntax tree node.
      Two fields are of special interest: <code>Text</code>
      which is of type <code>string</code>, and <code>Lex</code>
      which is of type <code>LxK.LexKind</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>Text</code> corresponds directly to a piece of source code.
      It is a substring, and as strings in Go are immutable, it produces
      no copies of the input string.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>LxK.LexKind</code> is an enum,
      defined in <code>src/core/module/lexkind</code> as a bunch of constants.
      This enum can both represent lexical kinds (<code>LEFTPAREN</code>, <code>RIGHTPAREN</code>, <code>IDENTIFIER</code>, ...)
      as well as node kinds (<code>IDLIST</code>, <code>TYPELIST</code>, <code>INSTR</code>, ...).
    </p>
    <p>
      The compiler can output lexemes by running <code>mpc --lexemes file.mp</code>.
      Consider the tokenization of the following excerpt:
    </p>
<pre><code>proc max[a,b:i32] i32
begin
	if a >= b begin
		return a;
	end
	return b;
end</code></pre>
    <p>
      The function signature would be tokenized like so, with quotes added to remove ambiguity:
    </p>
<pre><code>"proc", "max", "[", "a", ",", "b", ":", "i32", "]", "i32"</code></pre>
    <p>
      Each substring marked with their respective <code>LexKind</code> according to the
      rules in <code>src/lexer/lexer.go:245</code>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="scopes">Scopes</h2>
    <p>
      Millipascal has only 3 nested scopes.
      The <i>global</i> module scope, where procedures, constants and data
      declarations are defined.
      The <i>argument</i> scope, where procedure arguments are defined.
      finally the <i>local</i> scope,
      that contains the variables declared inside procedures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both <i>Argument</i> and <i>Local</i> scopes are inside the <code>Proc</code>
      data structure, at <code>src/core/module/module.go:239</code>. While
      the <i>global</i> scope is inside the <code>Module</code> data structure,
      at <code>src/core/module/module.go:82</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All scopes are simple Go maps, for example, the global
      scope is defined as <code>map[string]*Global</code>, whereas
      the argument and local names are similar, with two structures:
      a map <code>map[string]int</code> that maps the identifier
      to a index, and an array <code>[]*Local</code> that contains the
      information about a local on that given index. Locals are stored
      in a different way to preserve order of arguments for the ABI.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./images/scopes.svg" alt="overall">
      <figcaption>scopes of millipascal</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The compiler checks if a name exists by first checking against
      the local scope, if it fails, then it checks the argument scope,
      then the global scope. Following the direction of the arrows in the
      above diagram.

      <code>mpc</code> was a big project that took way too long to finish.
      I decided to archive it and write this exposition so that
      it can serve as a resource to future compiler beginners.
      Hopefully it was useful to you, or at least, i hope you
      had fun reading this.
